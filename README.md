## NOTE: THIS IS A ROUGH PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR INSTINCT2X

This fork contains some *extremely rough* proof-of-concept changes to get the app working for
instinct2x (a Connect IQ 3 device). The original repo can be found here: https://github.com/Gualor/garmin-gotchi

Without going into too many details, let's just that without any changes, the instinct2x version of this app would've required an additional ~200 KB available
application memory to load without modification, due to various differences between CIQ 3 (instinct2x) and CIQ 4 (instinct3solar45mm). But on the contrary, instinct2x
actually has ~32 KB less memory for `watchApp`s than instinct3solar45mm. Drastic changes had to be made.

Some of these changes will almost certainly make the app perform worse on instinct3solar45mm (and any other Connect IQ 4 devices),
not to mention the fact that they make the source much harder to maintain and understand. For example, `json.xml` is a new file which was generated from
tama.c/TAMA_PROGRAM (the tama ROM), using a combination of a one-off script (not included here) and some manual edits. In a perfect world, json.xml would be
automatically generated via a build process (so that you could use any ROM you want), but that doesn't currently happen.

Also in a perfect world, the requisite changes for instinct2x would be applied via conditional compilation (or other means) to ensure that the app would continue
to run on instinct3solar45mm without any performance changes (or other issues). However, since this is just a proof of concept, the changes for instinct2x have simply been applied unconditionally.

Additionally, some of the build switches in monkey.jungle may not work. For example:

- it is no longer possible to enable logging - logging will always be disabled
- the test ROM cannot be selected - the tama ROM will always be used

Finally, the new code is kind of a mess. It seems to work [*], but it's not exactly pretty.

- In some cases, dead code has been deliberately left in the source as comments,
instead of being removed, to provide context for new code which is optimized for instinct2x. This has not been in a consistent manner.
- Some of the new code uses hardcoded magic numbers
- [*] Speaking of which, the new code hasn't been extensively tested.

For these reasons, at this time these changes will not be submitted back to the original repository - they're simply not fit for production.


## Tamagotchi Gen 1 Emulator for Garmin Instinct 3

**GarminGotchi** is a complete rewrite of the original [tamalib](https://github.com/jcrona/tamalib) project (portable Tamagotchi emulator) from C to Garmin's [Monkey C](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/) language, developed specifically for the [Garmin Instinct 3 Solar 45mm](https://www.garmin.com/p/1315317/) smartwatch. It brings your nostalgic digital pet back to life right on your wrist.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Flash Instructions

### üìã Prerequisites

- [Garmin Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/)
- [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
- [Monkey C command line tools](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/reference-guides/monkey-c-command-line-setup/)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Alternatively, VSCode IDE with the Monkey C extension can be used instead of the CLI; follow this [guide](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/getting-started/) for step-by-step instructions.

### üõ†Ô∏è First-Time Setup

Build and sign executable:

```sh
make all
# or, equivalently
make key # Generates the developer key
make app # Compiles the watch application
```

(Optional) Run in the simulator:

```sh
make ciq # Launches Connect IQ simulator
# wait CIQ to open
make sim # Runs the app in Connect IQ simulator
```

### ‚åö Deploying to Watch

For app deployement on the watch you must sideload the .prg file onto your Garmin device using [Garmin Express](https://www.garmin.com/it-IT/software/express/windows/) or copy it to the device storage manually in developer mode, like so:

1. Enable Developer Mode on your watch.
2. Connect it via USB.
3. Copy bin/garmingotchi.prg to the `GARMIN/APPS/` directory.
4. Restart the watch to launch the app.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- üß† **Memory Constraints**: The app operates under tight memory limits, adding even one more class or making too many static variables/methods could result in the app not fitting RAM anymore at some point during execution. ROM is also an issue when adding emulator programs, but this is mostly avoidable using `Lang.ByteArray` instead of `Lang.Array<Lang.Number>` which will cut down size by 4.

- üßµ **Thread Watchdog Timer**: The Garmin Monkey C VM enforces a watchdog timer on each thread to prevent them from hanging and crashing the system; therefore, there are only so many emulator steps that we could fit in that time frame. Optimizing the code further could enable us to increase `GarminGotchiApp.RUN_MAX_STEPS` and make the game run smoother.

Despite these constraints, the game can be enjoyed at a slightly reduced cycle speed with all original functionalities.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclamer

I am not a Garmin software developer and I mostly work with low-level languages, so a lot of stuff I had to figure out myself and hack my way around to make this port work; most likely there are better ways for running the game smoothly on the watch without issues, I am just not aware of them.

If you are a professional Garmin SW dev and want to share your knowledge or even contribute to the project, it would be very much appreciated!
